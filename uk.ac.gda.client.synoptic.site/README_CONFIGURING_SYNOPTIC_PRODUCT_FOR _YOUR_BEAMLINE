The Synoptic product is a stripped down GDA Client which by default shows a perspective which only has the Synoptic view.

The same compiled product can be used on every beamline. To configure the product for your beamline you need:

1. synoptic configuration files. To be stored by convention in:
  - {gda.config}/clients/main/synoptic
  - or, if the beamline staff need to be able to edit the files, {gda.config}/var/synoptic
  
2. a separate client xml config file: {gda.config}/clients/main/{gda.mode}/synoptic.xml. Contents of this file should
be a reference to the beamline's adapter factory and any RMI exported scannables which the synoptic will use.

3. to edit the compiled synoptic product's synoptic.ini file so that the contents are identical to the regular GDA client,
EXCEPT change the gda.propertiesFile property to point towards the synoptic.xml file.

4. a synoptic launcher. By convention this should be called 'gdasynoptic' and be placed in the same location as the
gdaclient, gdalog, gdaservers commands.
