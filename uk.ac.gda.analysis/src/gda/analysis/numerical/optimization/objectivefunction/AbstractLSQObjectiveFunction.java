/**
 * An optimization algorithm needs a function to minimise For curve fitting this is generally something like the sum of
 * the squares of the differences between the data and your theoretical line i.e. a chisquared function However for
 * different experiments etc. people often prefer to employ specialised functions. (often refereed to as R-factors) This
 * often comes about when the chi squared emphasises parts of the data you're not really interested in. For example you
 * may really be interested in peak positions not peak amplitudes or sometimes chisquared fits emphasis fitting to the
 * high intensity regions of a curve. Anyway there are lots of R-factor functions out their for comparing computer
 * generated curves to experimental data.
