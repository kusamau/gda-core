	 * Construct a path to a file used as part of a unit test. This path will in part be based on the package of a
	 * passed in object. The starting point for the directory will be either determined from the 'Java property
	 * gda.tests' or if not set the 'Java property user.home + /gda/src'. The latter is a best guess at the default
	 * location of the GDA tests directory. The class of the object is then added to the path, of course replacing the
	 * dots with separators. Finally the filename is added to complete the path. Examples based on the object
	 * tests.gda.ddh.DDHTest and the filename java.properties would be as follows.
	 * <p>
	 * No gda.tests property but user.home returns /home/shk results in
	 * /home/shk/gda/src/tests/gda/ddh/DDHTest/java.properties
	 * <p>
	 * gda.tests set to /home/shk/gda_6_12_branch/src results in
	 * /home/shk/gda_6_12_branch/src/tests/gda/ddh/DDHTest/java.properties
	 *
	 * @param filename
	 *            The file's name.
	 * @param object
	 *            An object whose class is to be used for forming the end of the directory path.
	 * @return A complete path to the file.
