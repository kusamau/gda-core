/**
 * JSeam adapter class providing Java bindings to PINCER SEAM1 and SEAM2 C code. Currently only a Windows version is
 * available built on the native side using National Instruments Labwindows/CVI v7.1 but in principle a similar version
 * for Linux generic shared libraries could be built. The unmodified PINCER SEAM DLL is accessed via a generic JNI
 * native interface DLL called "seam.dll" using the method "callSeam (...)" for both SEAM1 and SEAM2 types. The full
 * path name of the PINCER SEAM '.lib' type library is passed as an argument to the JSeam JAVA methods "callJSeam1(...)"
 * and "callJSeam2(...)". These methods are called by JCLAM to allow SEAM1 and SEAM2 function calls. Windows DLLs must
 * be included in the system path (recommended), system directory or current directory. See SR Newsround issue 10 for a
 * description of the XRD PINCER SEAM. The JSeam class implements a singleton pattern and initially loads the
 * "seam.dll".
