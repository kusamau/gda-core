/**
 * Parker6kWatchDog class for Parker 6k motor controller. This sends a heartbeat packet to watchdog port 5004 of the
 * controller that specifies a timeout period and number of retries. This runs every half timeout period keeping the 6k
 * watchdog alive. If the 6k does not receive the heartbeat e.g. due to network errors or the Java program has
 * terminated then the 6k times out and resets the TCP servers on ports 5002 and 5004 ready for new connections. The
 * motor Java code has no "tidyup()" method and Java will not reliably call a finalize method so this is the only way to
 * (badly) disconnect from the 6k. To use this class, construct with host name or IP address string and timeout value in
 * secs then call setup() method to connect to the watchdog port and launch the daemon thread (which can
 * auto-reconnect).
