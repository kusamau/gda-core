 * to make sure that the motors are up to speed. Assumes that the shutter will be triggered open slightly before
 * openPosition and triggered to close slightly before closePosition.

 * exposure range. Right before points 3 and 4, the shutter will be triggered to open
 * (shutterOpenIsTriggeredPosition) or close, respectively. gda/px/camera/Trigger will handle
