 * This can be used as a base class for collection strategies that can be decorated and their decorators (which can also themselves be decorated). It provides
 * support for a strategy/decorator to record whether it is called by a decorator (as opposed to being called directly by a scan runner) and also provides dummy
 * implementations of saving/restoring state. Derived classes should in general save/restore their state if called directly, but not if called by a decorator,
 * as the decorator will save state for each of its decoratees.
