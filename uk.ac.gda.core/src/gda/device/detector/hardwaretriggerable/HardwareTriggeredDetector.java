/**
 * A hardware triggered detector can be configured to accept hardware triggers from a {@link HardwareTriggerProvider}
 * representing a controller that it is physically wired to (e.g. a {@link ContinuousMoveController}). To work with the
 * {@link TrajectoryScanLine} class, an implementation should behave as described here:
 * <p>
 * An AbtsractContinuousScanLine will call {@link Detector#setCollectionTime(double)}, then
 * {@link #setNumberImagesToCollect(int)} then {@link Detector#prepareForCollection()}. The implementation will then
 * have {@link Detector}{@link #readout()} or if implemented {@link PositionCallableProvider#getPositionCallable()}
 * called for each point that *will* be collected. A call to {@link Detector#collectData()} will then be made which should
 * in this mode of operation arm the detector.
 * <p>
 * Most implementations should also implement {@link PositionCallableProvider} indicating that they will return data via
 * {@link Callable}s which block until the data is actually available. Implementing {@link PositionInputStream} and
 * deferring calls to {@link PositionCallableProvider#getPositionCallable()} to a {@link PositionStreamIndexer} may be
 * the simplest way to do this.
 * <p>
 * Detectors which operate in applications that require variable trigger times during a scan should implement
 * {@link VariableCollectionTimeDetector}.
