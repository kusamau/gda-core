/**
 * A hardware triggerable detector can be configured to accept hardware triggers from a {@link HardwareTriggerProvider}
 * representing a controller that it is physically wired to (e.g. a {@link ContinuousMoveController}). To work with the
 * {@link TrajectoryScanLine} class, an implementation should behave as described here:
 * <p>
 * When configured to trigger from hardware an implementation should do nothing when asked to {@link #collectData()}. It
 * should instead wait for a call to {@link #arm()} during which it should prepare to respond to hardware triggers. When
 * asked to {@link #arm()} the {@link HardwareTriggerProvider#getNumberTriggers()} will indicate how many trigger should
 * be expected.
 * <p>
 * Most implementations should also implement {@link PositionCallableProvider} indicating that they will return data via
 * {@link Callable}s which block until the data is actually available. Implementing {@link PositionInputStream} and
 * deferring calls to {@link PositionCallableProvider#getPositionCallable()} to a {@link PositionStreamIndexer} may be
 * the simplest way to do this.
 * <p>
 * Detectors which operate in applications that require variable trigger times during a scan should implement
 * {@link VariableCollectionTimeDetector}.
