/**
 * <code>gda.data.fileregistrar</code> contains code used for notifying (possibly external) entities
 * when files are created. Main purpose is archiving and indexing, but data processing could also be 
 * triggered. 
 * 
 * 
 *      <p> There are two main routes. One is directly by a detector, a processing task or anything else
 *      that creates a file that needs archiving to find classes implementing IFileRegistrar from the Finder
 *      and call their registerFile method(s) or use the FileRegistrarHelper class to ease that task.
 *      <p> The other route is implemented in the concrete FileRegistrar class which also implements 
 *      DataWriterExtender. If that extender is added to a DataWriter (via a DataWriterFactory for example)
 *      it received ScanDataPoint through it. The SDP are inspected and Filenames in it that originate from 
 *      file-writing detectors are registered automatically.
