/**
 * Encapsulates a recursive function which determines if the current {@link Scannable} or {@link ScannableGroup} in
 * the MScan command is being used as a readout (like a monitor). At the simplest level this is true if it is
 * followed by a {@link Detector} or {@link Monitor}, or by another {{@link Scannable}/{@link ScannableGroup}.
 * However this is only true if we are already within or at the beginning of the section of the command string
 * that is after all the scan path definitions, since two {@link Scannable}s one after another could be the start
 * of a valid mapping scan path definition.
 *
 * Because of this, the rule is enforced that the overall scan command must be made up of a first section that
 * contains only scan path definitions and no {@link Monitor}s, {@link Detector}s or {link @Scannable} readouts
 * and a second section for which the reverse is true. This means that {{@link #isAPureScannableUsedAsReadout} must
 * be called after the current {@link Scannable} has been checked to see if it is the start of a SPEC style scan or
 * a Mapping one, since it operates on the basis that these cases have already been eliminated.
