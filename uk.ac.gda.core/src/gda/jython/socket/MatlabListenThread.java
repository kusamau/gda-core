/**
 * Listens to a port connected to the GDA.
 * <p>
 * To run this class in Matlab, you need to import all the jar files used by the GDA. The client machine must also have
 * Jython installed and the jython.jar in the Jython install directory added to the Matlab classpath as well.
 * <P>
 * To make Matlab talk to the GDA run the following commands:
 * <p>
 * import gda.jython.*
 * <p>
 * import gda.jython.socket.*
 * <p>
 * client=SocketClient()
 * <p>
 * client.setHost('machine running GDA object server')
 * <p>
 * client.setPort(port number);
 * <p>
 * client.connect()
 * <p>
 * newThread1 = MatlabListenThread(client.in)
 * <p>
 * newThread1.start()
 * <p>
 * client.send('print "Hello, World!"')
 * <p>
 * all output which would normally go the GDA terminal will aslo now go to the Matlab standard out.
 * <P>
 * Output from scans will be placed into 2-dimensional string arrays using the readData() method. Users may then display
 * or manipulate that data as they want.
 * <P>
 * Note that the buffer holding scan output must be manually cleared using the clear() method before more scans are run,
 * else data sets will be merged.
