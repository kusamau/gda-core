The Generic Data Acquisition (GDA) software was initially developed at `SRS Daresbury <http://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/target/15237169/source/search>`_.
In 2003 it was adopted by `Diamond Light Source <http://www.diamond.ac.uk/>`_, who took over as the principal developer.

This section lists people who have contributed in some way (code, design, documentation) to the GDA project. Names are ordered alphabetically by surname.
