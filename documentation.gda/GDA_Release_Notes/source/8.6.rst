GDA 8.6  (released 11/Jun/2010)
===============================

- GDA-3209: Removed bodges in ``ScanDataPoint`` and ``ContinuousScan`` that account for detectors with improperly set
  ``outputFormat``\s. ``ScanDataPoint.toString()`` will magically work if ``extraNames`` returns ``String[] {"%s"}``. Better
  still, see instructions from the :ref:`GDA 8.2 <release_8.2>` release notes to actually properly configure ``extraNames``.

- GDA-3193: In ``gdascripts.scannable.detector.ProcessingDetectorWrapper`` removed
  ``BodgedProcessingDetectorWrapperWithRobustLoading`` and ``BodgedProcessingDetectorWrapper``. Functionality can
  be configured in ``ProcessingDetectorWrapper``'s constructor: robust loading will be used if ``fileLoadTimout``
  is set; file paths will be bodged to numbers if ``returnPathAsImageNumberOnly`` is true.

- GDA-2822: changed the ``isPositionValid`` method in ``Scannable`` to ``checkPositionValid`` - the new method returns a ``String``
  instead of a ``boolean`` to enable better reporting of invalid positions to users.

- GDA-3222: when a scan is halted prematurely by user stopping it or by an error, ``stop`` will be called on all detectors
  in the scans as well as all scannables.

- GDA-3248: The Rich Bean Framework now writes the XML files it creates to a folder called ``xml`` which is at the
  top-level of the visit's data directory instead of being stored inside the visit's workspace folder. This
  makes manual editing of the XML files easier and allows for deletion of the workspace should it become
  corrupted without loss of the XML files.
