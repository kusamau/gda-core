How to create notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the git command: ``git log --no-merges --pretty="format:%aD, %an, * %s [%an - %h] %b" gda-8.42rel..gda-8.44rel > /tmp/reponame.version.csv``

2. Open up in excel or the likes,
   
   a. Sort by name, as we tend to work in our pet areas and this makes categorisation simpler (also message quality is likewise correlated).
   b. Add an empty column to fill with single character tags. These will become component headings. e.g.  'u' for user 'dz' for developer+zebra.
   c. Sort by the tab columns

3. Cut each tag group paste to the release notes file under the appropriate heading.

4. Fixup the reStructuredText.

5. Tweak the text of the user highlights at the top.
