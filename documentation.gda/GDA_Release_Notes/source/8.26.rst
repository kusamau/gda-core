GDA 8.26  (Aug/2012)
====================

Changes to ConcurrentScan (used by standard 'scan' command and all scan wrappers)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The DetectorWithReadout interface has been deprecated (this was used only on I18).
   Set gda.scan.concurrentScan.readoutConcurrently to true instead (after reading the 8.24 release note).

Changes to materialize directory layout
---------------------------------------
Previously, Git repositories were materialized to:

    | ``${workspace}_git/${repo-name}.git`` (repositories other than SciSoft)
    | ``${workspace}_git/scisoft/${repo-name}.git`` (SciSoft repositories)

Since the name of most SciSoft repositories starts with ``scisoft-`` anyhow, the extra level in the directory hierarchy for those repositories was deemed unnecessary, and has been removed.
Now, all Git repositories are materialized to:

    | ``${workspace}_git/${repo-name}.git``
