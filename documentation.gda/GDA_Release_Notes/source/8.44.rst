When creating the GDA client, the "client" symlink can optionally be created or updated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: Buckminster "create.product" can optionally create a "client" symlink

A new Buckminster action (accessed from the :menuselection:`Buckminster --> Involve Action...` menu), has been added:

    ``create.product-linux.gtk.x86_64-with.symlink``

The new action does the following (only available when building a linux64 product):

    #. Performs the standard ``create.product-linux.gtk.x86_64`` action
    #. Deletes any existing ``client`` symlink (which presumably links to the previous product build)
    #. Create a ``client`` symlink which links to the new product build

.. rubric:: ``pewma.py`` can optionally create a "client" symlink

From the command line, the new action can be invoked using ``pewma.py`` option ``--recreate-symlink`` as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pewma.py --workspace /path/to/workspace --recreate-symlink product <site.project.name> linux64

How to create notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the git command:``git log --no-merges --pretty=format:\%aD\, \%an\, \* %s [%an - %h] %b\ 8.40rel..HEAD > /tmp/reponame.version.csv``

2. Open up in excel or the likes,
   
   a. Sort by name, as we tend to work in our pet areas and this makes categorisation simpler (also message quality is likewise correlated).
   b. Add an empty column to fill with single character tags. These will become component headings. e.g.  'u' for user 'dz' for developer+zebra.
   c. Sort by the tab columns

3. Cut each tag group paste to the release notes file under the appropriate heading.

4. Fixup the reStructuredText.

5. Tweak the text of the user highlights at the top.
