GDA 8.2  (released 1/Mar/2010)
==============================

General improvements to many aspects of the GUI.

Changes made to the gda.scan package:

 - Scans have had their list of Monitors removed (Monitors are Scannables so 
   should always have been included in that list)
 - Code in Scans and DataHandlers which treat CounterTimers as special cases
   of detectors has been removed. CounterTimers should populate their extraNames
   attribute properly. Now all Detectors are expected to return data from their 
   readout method either by:

     1. returning a string of the name of the file they create (and have a 
        single element in their extraNames array)
     2. be a NexusDetector and so return a self-describing object
     3. return an array of values whose elements are described by the extraNames array
     
   (This has always been the case but this rule has been reinforced by recent changes)
 - ScanDataPoint class has the various constructors removed: now more bean-like
 - ScanDataPoint no longer makes calls to getPosition of Scannables and readout 
   of Detectors. This information should be added using the accessor functions.
