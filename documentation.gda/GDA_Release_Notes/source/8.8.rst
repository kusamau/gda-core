GDA 8.8  (released 21/Sep/2010)
===============================

- Remove ``NamedSimpleConverter``, which looks up its underlying converter by name using the ``Finder``.
  ``SimpleConverter`` should be used instead; this has a ``converter`` property for the underlying converter.

- CounterTimer interface as been refactored. Now a detector returning an array of doubles should implement the Detector
  interface and define the number of expected doubles through its extraNames array. The CounterTimer interface is now only for
  detector classes whose timing is controlled by an external Timer object (i.e. at the moment this is only TFG driven detectors).
  The following classes have been moved up a level out of the countertimer package:
  
  - NI6602
  - Counter6602GUI
  - CounterTimerPanel
  - AsynEpicsScaler
  - Epics8512CounterTimer
  - EpicsMCACounterTimer
  - EpicsScaler
  
  For simulation purposes DummyConutertImer should not be used unless you wish to simulate a matching DummyTFG class. Instead
  use DummyDetector and define arrays of extraNames and outputFormats.
  For classes remaining in the CounterTimer package the attributes tfg and tfgName have been renamed to timer and TimerName as 
  these names are more correct as it is via the Timer interface that the object is used. 

SwingGui Changes
----------------

- To close the GUI down automatically when the server dies there are properties to set for gda.gui.BatonPanel:

  - closeDownOnBatonRenewTimeout - set to True
  - closeDownOnBatonRenewTimeoutTimeMinutes - e.g. 2.0
  - closeDownOnBatonRenewUserPromptTimeMinutes - e.g. 0.1
